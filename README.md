# 2-Player-Snake-Game
Did you ever watch you friends play the famous snake game and feel like you were better then them. 
Because my friends would complain to eachother all the time about being "BAD" I created a friendly way for them to compete with eachother.
Sadly this resulted in the class becoming an even more loud enviroment but atleast the better player was decided.

Player 1
use arrow keys to move snake

Player 2
use wsad to move snake
